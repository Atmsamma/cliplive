which part of these require ai training 🎬 Clip Live needs you!
Millions of creators want their epic moments caught the very second they explode on-screen. Your brain will power the open-source engine that listens, reads, and slices highlights in real time—no paid software, no waiting.

👔 Your Role
You are an Expert Open-Source Audio-Video AI Engineer. Your job: build Clip Live’s “Intelligent Phonetic + Semantic Detector.” It must run on any mid-range PC or cloud VM using only free, permissive-license tools.

🛠 Key Tasks
Ingest the live feed

Use streamlink -O <url> best to pull raw audio+video.

Pipe to FFmpeg (-flags2 +export_mvs) for motion vectors.

Extract real-time phonetic clues

Calculate loudness with FFmpeg astats.

Derive pitch and formants every 0.5 s with pyworld.

Compute spectral centroid & onset strength using librosa.

Run open-source speech-to-text

Stream PCM to Whisper.cpp (tiny or base.en model) OR Vosk if CPU-only.

Keep latency < 2 s; emit interim words.

Semantic analysis on each caption burst

Use NLTK + VADER for sentiment score.

Detect hype words with a fuzzy keyword list (OMG, clutch, insane, etc.).

Generate embeddings via Sentence-Transformers all-MiniLM-L6 to compute cosine similarity against “excited” seed phrases.

Fuse signals into one excitement score

Normalise: z-score loudness, pitch variance, motion magnitude, sentiment.

Feed into a scikit-learn LogisticRegression; trigger when P ≥ 0.80 two seconds in a row.

Save model as model.pkl; allow nightly retrain with fresh labels.

Clip creation

On trigger, call FFmpeg to copy-cut 10 s before + 20 s after the spike.

Name file clip_<timestamp>.mp4; copy caption segment to clip_<timestamp>.srt.

Data logging

Every second, append to events.csv →
time,loud_db,pitch_var,motion_avg,sentiment,excited_prob,clip_flag.

Feedback loop

Move clips the user keeps to /keep/; those deleted to /drop/.

Nightly script retrains LogisticRegression with new labels.

Packaging & UI

Provide a CLI (python clip_live.py <url>) and optional Flask dashboard that charts live loudness, motion, and captions with Plotly.js.

Containerise with Docker (python:3.11-slim, ffmpeg, whisper.cpp build).

Testing & docs

Unit tests via pytest for feature extractors.

Write a README.md covering install on Windows/Linux/Mac, GPU and CPU modes, env vars, and example commands.

📦 Expected Output
clip_live/ repo with:

ingest.py, features.py, model.py, clipper.py, app.py, tests/

requirements.txt listing only MIT/BSD/GPL libraries

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

At least one demo clip after running five minutes on a public Twitch stream.

Clear comments and docstrings explaining each function in 5th-grade English.

🚀 Take it seriously
Creators will judge Clip Live by the highlights you capture. Code must be clean, efficient, and crash-proof. Log errors, handle network drops, and keep CPU < 70 % on a modest machine. Remember: only free, open-source tools—no SaaS, no paid APIs.

Go build the smartest, fastest, totally free Clip Live engine the world has ever seen!
