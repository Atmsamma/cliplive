I saw many of you said the songs, Kiss Kiss by Chris Brown. So thank you, noted. Also, so we guys asked about the timer.

And you can do something in such a way that like at $300, $400 a month, you still run insane margins on it because your stick rates really good and it costs you almost nothing to run. That's option one. That's the low cost high volume model. And it works fine, but you have to build the business day one with that low cost volume model so that you're dealing with these small business owners. You have to price it their worst month out their best month. Now, the second scenario is that you have to go after higher, you have to go after whales, right? You have to go up market.

I should know this differently. So those are the two end states. It's either you're going to build this day one with like super AI enabled, super automation enabled. So that you can do this at low cost or you're going to say I got to go whale hunting. But the thing is it's very hard to sell whales with no proof.

Or you actually price it in a way that you can have a charge of premium, but you can only do that with people who can afford it, which is up market. So if you look at the biggest agencies in the world, which is basically what you are, you either gotta go like, you know, super cheap, super high volume or premium whales, Ogle V, you know what I mean?

Yeah, we build their business from the ground up so we've done um, two businesses that we've gotten to a million in under a year We typically our runway is usually 0 to 20 or 30k months in the first four-ish months um All right, because we're positioning like a high ticket So can i that's right?

So basically I would rather you just do this. Instead of having like hey every month we're going to try and see if we can launch three of these guys businesses. Yeah, it's horrible. Instead, it's like so much brain power. So that's part of it is like we're limited right now on capacity because it's like I can only, I mean, you know, I mean, you get it. Yeah, let me help.

But we obviously didn't build that in to the contract early on. And so now as we get to equity discussions, it's pretty easy for him to discredit. I personally do not even know he's in the business. It's not. Listen to me. Listen to me. I'm going to help. You can just stop doing everything. Okay. And then so this is a game of leverage. Okay.

I might say if I I'll take risk on just for 10 percent. Right? Just depends on who you are.

I would say how much time and effort is just going to go into it. What would I like to make? What percentage would it require for me to make that amount of money?

So it's not the actual, when I need his motivated seller listings, I actual motivated people like not just people who say they want to sell their price that is, is not going to sell on this market. So I'm struggling with consistency with inbound leads for sure. And then outbound is like the machine is just probably get a bunch of people to call. Yeah, if I'm very unrealistic. Yeah. Yeah. So so there's there's two things here. One foundation, we are in a market cycle where it is hard to sell in this market because the seller assumes that they, you know, and they put in the COVID market. They own, they had significantly more equity. They can't see themselves in this market. And they're seeing themselves in this market struggle with rates if they refight, etc. So you have a tough seller market."

So in this is the problem, you know I'll just tell you this most most folks in multi-family world state are so seller centric in a seller centric economy But the problem being seller centric right now is that The seller is not willing to sell right so so let me give you a hack around How to think about how to fix the other side of the equation think about how to get extremely motivated buyers Because if you get an extremely motivated buyer then they have to take the offer that sellers actually will say yes to for example Right now we're working on multiple deals where we are the seller and the extremely motivated buyer is Somebody we can go to with a 1031 exchange and say you have to buy this you have no choice Yes, right?

So have you considered something like that?"

So it's funny, we just, today actually, Alex, we just started a school community, but it's for AI and commercial estate. So there's a bunch of different people, brokers, and other people, so not specifically sellers. We just started that today. We got 55 people, so that's pretty sick. Amazing. Dude, I will tell you this. If the long-term game is to get more sellers, then just think about it. Say if you were able to call in Homoziot line in two years and say you had the largest community of multifamily owners in Los Angeles County, think about how powerful that is. Right? You have literally written an insurance policy on your business forever. And by the way, if you were to ever want to sell your business, you've created an asset that you can literally say, I have a working CRM of all the multifamily owners in Los Angeles right now.

And it's a benefit to coming on the podcast, to say by the way, all past podcast guests who are all in the same space, get to join this community, but I'm the gating function. So then you also now control a scarce resource, so then you further edify yourself for the conversation because in the moment, if they hop on the podcast with you, you're gonna be like, some agent who's gonna try and sell them stuff, let's just be real, right? But instead here, it's like, no, I actually have influence. And I have status because I control this resource of hundreds of other people who are above you. So basically you can leverage the collective status of all people above them in their own game, but because you gated, you gained status in that conversation, which then completely flips the paradigm. And then also you have the authority, so when you say, hey, you need to buy now, or like, hey, you need to sell now. Then the list, yeah.

So is there a model, Shron or Alex where you can pull income forward? Yes you can. So very good job thinking about this. The way you pull income forward is to change the way you actually categorize income. For example, is it easy to pull commission income forward? Probably not because the traditionally commission income is tied to the performance of a transaction but you can charge income in a different way. You can say hey I have 30 consulting clients. I charge each of my consulting clients $8,000 a year. I'm making up numbers by the way, right?

So you can go get purchasing power on one side where you are the consultant and get get recurring income on the consulting side. And then you dramatically discount commission and transaction fees. I'll give you the craziest example. I told Alex, I told this guy this to an agent who sells in my neighborhood. I said, go to everybody in the HOA until everybody in the HOA to pay $200 a year. And if they paid you $200 a year, right? Then they're automatically all their commissions are cut by 50%. Like every, that person would get every single sale in that neighborhood and get get the recurring income of that. Anyway, so you just own that neighborhood, no one can enter that neighborhood ever again. So you got to, you can't get, you can't pull forward a commission because it's in their mind, tied to a transaction, but you can do it in a different way. And still, as Alex would say, you can get the discount on the back end by getting the getting paid on the front end. So you're saying like the five deny in the morning, right?

In two years, you call back in the hormones you outline and you say, listen, it's been two years, and I am the only group in Los Angeles County.

And so the thing, the starts with who do we wanna make our associations with? Right? And so in the beginning, when we're making associations, the goal here from a branding perspective is four things.

Is there evidence in the world that what we have said is true? Now I want to be clear with each of these objectives is that one thing can happen that checks multiple of these boxes. Right? So like if I sell a company for example, it gives me credibility because this guy has sold a company before and for a large amount of money. Also the money from that sale gives me status because status, money gives status because it's a scarce resource. All right? Now let me pull this out. If I just had money, I'm a trust fund kid for example or something like that. If that were me, I'm not that. So don't clip this you crazy person. Okay? All right. I'm not a trust fund kid. But if I, but if there were trust fund kid, right? That guy would have money and you'd have more status than somebody who has no money. But you would not have credibility."

So you'd have more influence than someone who has nothing, but not as much influence as someone who had done something. So we got status. We have power that you father advice and then something could happen. You have credibility, right? You have proof in the outside world. And you have likeness, right? So are they similar to me in both the way they look, but also the way they behave, their values, et cetera? And so if you think about like the most influential person in the world for you specifically, would be someone who is your identical twin, right? Who has done things and has proof that what they've done worked, then they told you to do something. You did that thing and it worked. And if they have more influence, they've told you to do thousands of things and thousands of things worked. And they have the original status, which is like they have something that you want that they have. And so that would be like the most influential person in your life. Now, if you think about this from the perspective of like a parent, right, a parent."

They've told you to do zillions of things throughout your life. And many of them, despite the fact that you might have some weird relationship with your parents. Now, many of those things did work when they said, you know, like don't touch that. It'll hurt. And then things happened according to plan, right? Now, whether they have credibility, different question, whether they have status, different question. But you can imagine, you know, if some guy is into business or wants to be in business and their father was involved in their upbringing and has status, has credibility, has told them to do things that it worked. And they are similar to them. That person probably has tremendous influence over there. Try it, right? And so, why am I explaining these four things? So when we're creating a brand, we're trying to demonstrate as many of these things as possible. And so I want to be clear here, there's entertainers and there's educators. I'm specie more specifically to educators, because I would say that's the vast majority, like far more people."

Okay. They've done something they've messed up. Yeah, maybe they"

They've done something, they've messed up, maybe they've oversold, maybe they made a mistake online, they've posted something icky. How do you think about dealing with branding mistakes? And I know you've got a formula in here. So here's my best analogy for you. And I talk about it in the branding playbook. So if we have a bouquet of roses, so if I give Layla a bouquet of roses, yes, I get a Layla, I've given you flowers before. So I give Layla a bouquet. I'll tell you what I said. I promise you do more. So I give Layla bouquet of roses, right? Now if I give the bouquet of roses, fine, let's consider that my reputation. Okay, there's all these roses. Now all of a sudden, if I hand Layla's bouquet of roses and then one of them is rotten or broken or both, it kind of spoils the impression of the roses. Now if I have four roses and one of them is cracked, it's like, it's like silly as it sounds, it's a black eye on the bread, right? Now how do you overcome this? And here's one of the things with branding."
2025-08-19T00:23:23.310670,43.930343363573854,25.69106418903602,0.2732675977359251,-0.9287,0.18828833333333336,1.6333333333333335,0.5,False,"on the brand, right? Now, how do you overcome this? And here's one of the things with branding that everyone, like I think people fairly understand, you can't ever remove the broken flower. It's permanent. That association occurs, but you can dilute its influence on the person. So I'll explain. So if I still have this broken flower, what do I do? Well, if I have seven bouquets of red flowers and there's one broken flower, she's probably not going to notice it that much. And so this is fundamentally how you can recover from a branding mistake, is making more higher volume associations with the good stuff and fewer associations with the bad stuff. Now, within that context, I talk about this in the playbook, all right? There's three kind of degrees from an influence perspective that I think through in terms of a brand. And they are in increasing order of effectiveness. On the furthest out run, you have the things that you say about you."
2025-08-19T00:24:32.781572,76.54792278983751,28.588871626003655,0.1766695968378332,0.9839,0.8593649999999999,1.65,0.5,False,"Right? That's the furthest rung out. Maybe they'll believe it, maybe they don't, whatever. Right? The next rung is what other people that they respect say about you. Significantly more powerful. This is a reason that social proof reviews. Like, if a window to split this in two would be other people that you don't know. And then other people that you do know and have influence. So if I would just split that second ring in half, that's what it would look like. So generic social proof. And then even within that category of social proof, other people that you don't know. It'd be other people you don't know who are exactly like you. Would be more powerful than other people you don't know who are not like you. All right? Hopefully this is making sense. Now, the bottom and the closest rung to influence over you is what you think about the person. And the way that that actually occurs is going to be your experience with the products or services that that business has delivered to you. So I'll explain. So Apple has, you know, for years has had a really wonderful brand. Right? I'll give you an Nike example too. They have these great associations with these, you know, goats and these super aspirational figures, right?"

All the best associations, but if the product sucks, people find out pretty quickly. And so you'll get the first purchase, which is why the brand loop has to be continued through products back up to the top again. Right? And so if you create this image and you make these associations, enough that people do want to make a purchasing decision, once they make that decision, it doesn't matter how good I say a restaurant is. It doesn't matter how good I see a movie is. You see the movie ads, but the movie says about itself. You hear a friend say, you know, I saw that movie. And if the friend, you see other people saying they saw the movie and you heard it was good, then your friend sees the movie. And as long as you have the same taste in movies as your friend, then you might think, okay, well, now it's significantly more likely that I'll watch this thing. But at the end of the day, once you watch the movie, you're going to decide if you like the movie or not. And so this is kind of how you walk through this from a longer term perspective. And so hopefully that makes sense. And this is some of the stuff I talk about in the branding playbook, which is right now."

And I noticed this five years ago, which is why I wanted to like, you know, I had to change my stripes. I had to like, I gotta get ahead of this. And so I started making content, right? And so the thing, it was like worried, like, oh, it's too late to start. Actually, it's a really good time to start and I'll explain why. Five years ago, eight years ago, content worked a lot more like an email list, which is like, you know, people would see some content and then they would hit subscribe and then they would get that content, almost like a digital email list. It's shifted now with TikTok and the algorithms to change. So it's become interest medium or than social media, but the term is still there social media, but I wish everyone just called interest media. And so if you're like, man, what type of content do I make in order to build the brand that I want, we need that content to attract the rights of a customer, which means you don't want to make content just to get views. If you do, if you just remake memes, right now for us, the green men was the whole thing that, you know, that we did because we wanted to have, I'll explain that."

Great, so I have all these different vectors of all these things. But when we productize this, we just say, listen, people need to move more, eat less, right, period.

And we'd say here, this is the product that you need done, right? And so we still ask the same questions, but then we just lead them to the answer, which is the type that I solution for them. And then by doing that, you can get, like the thing that I don't like about the business is that you said you fought really hard to get to 20% margins. And in a business like yours, I honestly think you should have super high margins, because you're not even the one who's really been doing the delivery.

So we have a couple different ways we do it One of them is just a flat markup on our subcontractors fee Don't like that one. I or what our advertised prices so make sure that our margins protected through the markup on the subcontractor fee and then Do you think like one thing I can tell you were about two X more expensive than every other Blu-In-Decore company Yeah, and so I don't know about raising my prices Today we actually just lost a multi-location client who said hey like every time I bid your projects out like I get some cheaper It's like yeah, that's not our value proposition Yeah, and we lost them not really sucks. We worked with them for over a year. Yeah So I'm gonna say something that I want to I want you to take the way I mean which is If you are the most expensive player you are not forever Yeah, and everyone's not for you and part of what you quote"

And part of what you quote pay for being the most expensive player is that you don't sell everybody. But when you do sell, you make 3, 4, 5 times the money. And there's always going to be somebody who's willing to do cheaper. So the fact that you lost somebody on price just means that we need to have a better sales process in general. And to be fair, you don't, you quote, lost that client. But how many other clients are you going to get that have we more money? For sure. Right? So I just don't want you to let this one thing. We always have recency bias of like, oh, I lost this one person. So I definitely can't raise prices. It's like it just happened yesterday. Yeah. Right? But like, at the same time, you're like killing yourself to get 20% margins in a business that should have significantly more override. Now, that being said, if I were to look at the, if I wanted to look under the hood, I'd be like, I'll bet you used this from cost in here that I don't know where it's going. But I would say in general, and for anybody who's listening, cost plus is almost always the worst model for pricing. Yeah. Yeah.

So because it has not, because like you want value based pricing, not cost plus pricing. That makes sense. Value based pricing is willingness to pay. What are they willing to pay? That's what we charge. That makes sense. One of the things that we did try is we actually raised the price of all of our all card item significantly. And then we created some bundles and then discounted those pretty steeply to try to push people into the bundles. And we mapped everything mathematically so it led to an overall pretty significant increase in that profit. We had a little bit of hesitancy on that. People were talking about it is too complicated. So we might just need to refine our messaging on that to get it clear. Bundle 1 to 3. Yeah. I mean, I like chicken, fish, steak, small, medium, large, whatever you want to say. I love 3 option, 3 card, Montany. But at the end of the day, we just need to lead customers to the option that ideally is the most profitable.

Dude, I think you just need to lean more into the corporate. Because you said they're reoccurring number one. The other ones aren't. I'm guessing do you have more pricing power with the corporate versus the one off? Yeah, dude. First share. Yeah, so one of the issues that happens, and you're literally in, if you go through the scaling roadmap, one to three million, you need to double down on the avatar. You're at this pattern. Like this is pattern, dude. Productize. Yeah, dude, 100%. You need to put, like, you were in the exact position that a zillion other entrepreneurs are at between one to three million. You need to productize, and you can only productize, because you've got to pick the avatar that has the highest LTVCAC ratio, which obviously the commercial one does. If you are going to get, again, I don't if you were listening to earlier on in this live stream, when you deal with commercial clients, a little bit more savvy for customer, but the way that you approach them is, you have to take a holistic view, right?

I'm saying, no, no, we have to look at it this global perspective, because when you look at global, then you have way more levers that you can influence, which is like, you wanna just get the best return on your money, and that's what I'm gonna get you. Because also it's like, you have these other guys, but how much effort and headache does it cost you? And this is where you can feed their egos and be like, listen, Mr. producer or buyer or whatever, you know, your name is, like, you make $150,000 a year, right? So you're gonna pay $75 an hour right now, and each of these other guys is costing you that plus switching costs of like getting headaches and getting reminded and all this other shit, right?

Yeah, so we just have, again, this is a framing issue. So you said you had four problems. Avatar, I think we just decided that, is that we need to continue, like I would be spending, how do we spend more, how do we change our messaging, how do we change our positioning towards more commercial clients, number one. Number two, the offer needs to get templatized, one, two, three, chicken, chicken, fish steak. The positioning is going to be global rather than local, meaning we have to look at the whole business in every cost and every gain that the business gets from the services we provide, not just how much does it cost to set up balloons, right? And then we use the messaging to communicate those three things. That makes sense. OK. Solid, man. I'm actually coming out to meet with you guys for L3 next month. Superbowl.

Then, yeah, yeah, then like we don't eat like the show rates and the qualification rates, like could they be better? Yes, is that the constraint of the business?

Okay, that's what I, that's what it should be at right now. Okay, I want to be clear. So if you're at 35%, your revenue right now would go from four to like 14. Okay, that's thing one. Now, if we also were able to implement a, I'll just say 10%, which is still absurd. I think you go more than that. But you have a 10% price race. Okay, now we're going from, we have a three and a half effects on 500K. So it's really a three and a half effects on a million. So we're doing three and a half million in EBITDA now. Does this business become more interesting? I mean, the obvious answer is yes, but I'm still not in love. No, no. Mainly, I mean, to be fair, we can't just sell that much overnight. We do have a bunch of capital expenditures, etc. Okay, well, we'll do with that constraint as it comes. Yeah, we'll do that because there's also in your industry, there's tons of financing partners that will help with that stuff. Yeah."

Because there's also in your industry, there's tons of financing partners that will help with that stuff. But if you were to do that, and if you were to get crazy, because that's what we're going to do, because why not? And you were to do a 20% price raise, not a 10% price raise. That would give you a triple in profitability. So then all of a sudden, that 1.5 times 3.5 becomes whatever, more than 5 million. I think it's like 6 or something like that. So it's like 5.7 or something like that. If you got to 5.7, this company can sell for $30 million. Or you have enough dry powder to hire an operator. Of course, yeah, of course. We do that. OK. So let's just, because I don't have time to fix all these issues. We're just going to try to focus on one of them. So right now, walk these sales process. I know this is good for other people who are listening, which is why I'm taking a little over of those. OK. OK, yeah. So essentially, we get a lead, a book, and appointment with our sales rep. And it's over the phone. We do an initial discovery call, where we also give rough pricing based on how that goes."

Okay. It's not going to go away. So the problem right now is that you essentially run a media arbitrage business. You just sell clicks, you sell clicks for less than you buy them for. That's the business you're in right now. It's a very easy business to do at small numbers and gets increasingly difficult as you scale. Okay. So what you need is you need another vehicle that's going to drive down a pack as you scale. And so you basically have two options. One is you create some level of virality, actually, three options. One is that you create some level of virality around the product that customers bring more customers. I don't think that's likely. I don't say that that would be a path. The second option is that you go super hard core on the affiliates and you basically rely on them so much again."

And because you have SuperiorLTV, they, like now you're doing one-time acquisitions for affiliates who then send you recurring customers for life. And by recurring customers, I mean, they send you new customers every month, even though the customers are different. So it's more like, okay, you know, influencer A, I can reliably say, he will always send me five deals a month. And so when I sign him up once, I get five deals, quote, for life from that affiliate. And so we need to chunk up the way you think about the business. Instead of what's my LTVCAC per customer, we need to think about what's my LTVCAC per influencer. Right. Right. And so maybe it cost you $1,000 to get an influencer. And each influencer on average sends you $1,000 a month of gross profit, and they stay on average for 10 months. And then we need to start doing the economics from that level rather than at the consumer level. Okay. Okay. And. Okay, okay. Yeah.

It's usually a guy who's super-quant-driven, and I get it because I came from that world. Okay, so this comes from a place of love. I know you think you can solve this with a spreadsheet and you can't. So we need to start being, so the way to do it, I'll just finish and then I'll let you answer. When you do the affiliates, we need to be mindful of who these affiliates are, and we need to start slowly shifting the associations that we're making so that we can build this into a premium brand that will allow you to price higher and maintain lower-cap and retain the affiliates longer. Because the long-term vision of like, what does this look like when it's right? What does this look like long-term? Is that the affiliates want to keep promoting it because when they promote it."

That's how this works. Otherwise they're gonna be mercenaries and as soon as somebody else comes from the knockoff in China they get 11% is that 10% they're gone. Okay. That's it's work though man. I don't I don't I don't know sugar code it like you're making money and the thing is is that like you'll scale up and then your marketing will shrink and then you'll just consistently play this game until eventually you give up and be like oh I just think I need to find another product I think the product really saturated right now and you're gonna just jump from skew to skew to skew to skew to skew and there's tons of guys to do that their whole life and they make okay money but they never actually accomplish their goals. So you have to shift your brain in terms of how you think through this business and you have to shift towards what are the associations what is the brand that I want to build maybe there's five influencers that are absolute savages and they're gonna cost more to get but if you get them they'll feed the business way more than a lot of these ones

Now I can do clouds to dirt because I've been there so many times in different businesses, but I try to just so you guys are curious, like I try to cater my, my advice or steps or whatever based on the level of the company to try and solve it in that way. So if I'm talking to somebody who's two, you know, 20,000 dollars a month, I'm going to try and make the insights super tactical. Like we need to go from 10 reach outs to 20 reach outs, right?

Overall, would you say it different? Top two channels. I mean, I'll say this right now. So we measured ROI by channel. But that can be deceptive because everything that's closer to a transaction will always have what appears to be higher return.

And normally people take other steps prior to getting into the podcast world. And so I would say that right now the two channels that I think have the highest blended return meaning they capture new attention, but they also nurture is going to be Instagram primarily because it has, it's, there's so many ways to transact on Instagram. Right. So many ways to create like you can create calls to action on Instagram almost more effectively than any other platform. You can do stories. You can make posts. There's DM automation with many chat that you can create TM setters like there's so many different ways you can monetize on Instagram.

And I would say that for those you are making Instagram content, I would strongly recommend a way to make Instagram longer form in terms of its ability to persuade an influence is to create longer captions. Because the longer captions serve as basically more education than maybe you might be able to make inside of a very short video. And so that would shift it more towards LinkedIn, which has, for example, great monetization stuff. But it just has fewer people. And it's going to be more, not to say people haven't crushed LinkedIn, they have. But if I had to pick two, one would be Instagram, and the other would be YouTube. YouTube, right now, is still I think the king of, you get suggestion, you get discoverability, but you also get the ability to both make shorts and long. So shorts gets you even more discover, discovery. But the objective isn't to have a quote-shorts channel. So I'll tell you guys this little story, because that might be interesting for you guys.

Number two, they had short celebrities, TikTokers, you know, primarily. And then they had long former, so like YouTubers, things like that, and podcasters, whatever. And then they had streamers. So those were the four categories. And they said that the de facto, you know, phallus measuring contest, that's right, PG, was how loud your applause was when they said your name when you got introduced. And so it was really crazy is that when they had the Alistair celebrities, like it was almost inaudible, like barely anyone clapped when the Alistair's came out. Then the shorts weren't people, and it's a little bit louder, but barely, barely audible. Then the YouTubers came out and it was like applause.

And in my opinion, I think it's hard to get 100 pieces of shorts to get consumed. In my opinion. And so I do think that the shorts are valuable for two reasons. One is because you get facial recognition, which I do think is actually important. Like if you ever run ads later, people recognizing you, oh, I think I saw you in that thing. I think it's valuable. But secondary, and this is the main one, is that it brings them to deeper interactions that have more surface areas. So think about your shorts, at least as I think about them, as ads towards getting people into the longs. Right? And then the increased amount of content, like what's longer than a podcast? Read a book. Right? If you read a book, you're probably way more likely to like this stuff. Okay. So hopefully that was a little preview for. I'll say this one thing. This is a general theme for a lot of people. Like we have a lot of starting a business new. If you're in the AI automation, you can actually translate it across the board.

If you were starting out today with little or no capital, knowing what you know now, what type of business would you start? There's a, that theme is recurring. Okay. You should do yours in Aldumani, because I have, I'll bet you they're different."

So that is the first thing. The second thing is you also want any business that you don't have upfront capital. Right? So I will tell you my favorite thing if I were to start something right now, I would be a recruiter. Right? So if you think a real estate agent or a recruiter, what's the difference? A real estate agent has to go get a listing and then has to market the listing. That's to spend the money there, has to sit open houses, has to do all of that. Or a recruiter still has a listing but then can work it without any extra cost to be able to do that. Right? So if I were to start something today, want something performance based and second that I can actually do on my time and actually without a lot of spend upfront. So I'm going to piggyback on trance because you want to, when you have no capital, right? You only have skills. And so that means, and if you're going to do something performance based, then you want to sell the thing, you want to get a small percentage of something that has a lot of zeros. That's how."

Okay fine or I could get a higher level skill set and be like I can I can go recruit executives and also the term changes by the way to head hunting It's right and you want to be a head hunter not a recruiter no one's like I'm head hunting VA's It's ridiculous. Of course you're not head-hunting VA's right you're just you're catching with a net Right like we're hard-putting right we're looking for whales and so we need to use that language And so if you want to go hunt whales then you go find businesses that are bigger have the ability to pay and write big checks Because many of you might not know this but in recruiting it's typical to"

It's typical to charge 20% a commission, but the sale, the item that's being sold is what that person's going to get paid all the way. So if I recruit an executive that gets paid $750,000 a year, that's like being a salesman who sells a $750,000 product, but you get a 20% commission. Right. It's $150,000 a commission check. Per. Per. So like insane opportunity on that side. On the flip side, I come from the customer acquisition side. So I like, I have lost everything multiple times. I'll be here all week. Actually, I'll be here for the next five hours. So, so, at least before I'll do that or I'll pass out or the two. All right. The point is this. The, where's I going? All right. So, so I have lost everything."

Oh, so, so I have lost everything twice. And so I've, I've always operated off of performance. And so I went to business owners, locals the easiest. And you say, Hey, Mr. Business owner, if I get you customers, the, the easy, the cheap way of doing it is, if I get you customers will give me a commission. That's the easy way. My preferred way is, let me negotiate with the business and say, if I got you 100 customers, what's the cheapest you would sell your delivery for? And because if you go to a less sophisticated business owner, they're going to be like, well, you know, I sell my thing for 100, but I would, if you did 100 of them, I would do it for 50. And I say, great, 50's the number. Now what I'm going to go do is I'm going to go sell it for 1000 because I know how to sell. And then all of a sudden, of course, they're going to get a little upset and that's fine. And I'm going to say, Hey, I'm going to sell this for a lot more money. Now, old me would have just gone and sold it for way more. Newer me, it would be like, Hey, I just want to let you know, you agreed to 50. I'm going to stop here."

But I want to just sit this up because are you going to be upset if I go sell people at a thousand? And then if they push back, how do you overcome that? I would say, well, wouldn't you want somebody paid a thousand dollars rather than a hundred dollar customer? Because what do you think a thousand dollar customer can do? They can spend more money. And so you're going to be able to get all the LTV after this from this customer for life is long and do a good job. Right. And so from there, that's how I made my that's how I made my split. Now I went to businesses. Obviously gyms is what when I literally did this. They had basically no incremental cost to add a customer to a training session. Right. And so what I mean by that is if you've got a semi private training studio and you've got one trainer that can go up to six people in a session and you've got three there. You're still paying the train to the same amount. And so me putting two, three more people in there changes basically nothing for the cost basis of the business. And so most of those guys, if I said, hey, if I sell six weeks or eight weeks up front, can I sell that for whatever I want? And then afterwards and you should want me to sell that for as much as possible because then there."

Why? Because when you increase your costs based on your pricing method, your absolute profit goes up. Net by percentage is down, I'm gonna be clear. But like, then you're quoting things at higher jobs at higher amounts, because cost plus, is like, okay, well, it's $100 versus $1,000, that a $1,200 deal versus $120 deal, there's $20 versus $200. So we have no incentive, realistically, to decrease our prices, which is ridiculous. So we should be thinking fundamentally, what does the customer want, and what are they most afraid of? In any kind of home services type stuff, the thing they're most afraid of is that it's over budget, and that it breaks long term, and that it happens too slow, okay? And so we need to pick one or multiple of those vectors to guarantee against, so that a customer says, oh, this is different than the other thing, because they have guaranteed against my downside, and for that reason,"

And for that reason, I'm willing to pay a premium for the insurance that comes with it. That's so good. That's so good. By the way, the other problem with the Cosplus is the easy way out of just sending a quote. So if you can just, if you can just do those things, don't deliver, don't just send a quote on email or text. And when you're actually delivering the quote, use those three vectors as Alex was talking about. And you can actually say, all right, this is the fear that they have. And you can ensure against that, they automatically like, ah, that's the value, right? Because as soon as you de-risk them, they'll pay for whatever. Which is good. Awesome. You agree with the other one? Can you hold me this? Oh, there we go. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Questions, questions? This is a pretty tactical one. Which one of these will provide the fastest ROI from the start, meta ads, Google ads, Google search ads, or cold email? It's so general. For what business? Or what do you have cold?"

It's fastest ROI from the start. Yeah. Was it was add to one of them? Yeah, meta, good. Well, it adds it to the fastest. There's no, I mean, no question. But the thing is, it's an ads report skill. I mean, that's like, so like assuming you had maxed out skill, like that's, that's a significant one. Because it's like, if you were the, if you're, if you're Mr. Beast and you're the best content creator of all time, you can just make one video and just go super viral, right? And so then in that instance, like that would be the cheapest and fastest. Is it likely? No. I see outbound, in my opinion, as the, as the, as the beginners play to learning how to get customers. And I like this because it teaches volume. And it teaches you how to sell to cold prospects. Because if you ever go from cold outbound to, when you make content, which I recommend people do both of those things together. And the reason I like having, even what I consider a base level of content, not like, oh, I'm going to make content so I can get customers, I like to start with, you're going to make content so you look like you're alive.

Okay? And we have a pulse so that that content acts as lead nurture not as top of funnel. So what happens is you're going to do your outreach. What do you think the first thing they're going to do before they respond to your outreach is they're going to click your social profile because your social profile is now have become the de facto website. Right, who is this person, what are they about? Well, I'm going to go just consume some stuff and figure out what they're about. Right, if they go and they see the last post you had is May and it's August, they're like, oh, this guy's like not even legit. Right. So you just want to have a baseline of like, at least, I mean, it sounds crazy. We're like, I don't know, at least every three days, two or three times a week, at minimum, that you make a post on at least one platform and ideally link that platform or whatever your outreach mechanism is. And if you're doing outreach on a platform, then that should at least be the platform. Like if you're linked in, make some LinkedIn content. Right. And so those things kind of work in parallel. The nice thing is that the concept will bring you deals. They will, but see those in the beginning as, pops, they're more like, they're inconsistent, but they'll come in. Over time, it'll snowball and become, you know."

And I want to give you guys a huge business like medal lesson here, or at least something that I've learned that served me well. She's taking it if you want. Sell warm light cold and you will always convert maximally. So what happens is, and this happens to ton with people who are like content creators and things like that is that if they've never sold to cold traffic, they've never sold via outbound, they never sold via ads, they get spoiled with warm traffic because they don't have to have process. People come on, oh, I love your stuff. And you're like, thanks. I mean, yeah. So I was thinking, like, wanna talk about the product? Oh, yeah, sure. And then they're like, dude, I close everybody. It's like, it's them taking it as a superstar. And they have hot, like, you know, scolding hot audience. It's like, duh. If you need to get out of the way, like, you probably just have a transaction, they'll do it. But the thing is, is that when you apply that process to a cold, you're screwed. Yeah.

And that's the thing is that you want to always approach it as though no one knows who you are. And the thing is that somebody who does know who you are won't be bothered by you saying, oh, you know, I'm an oxymozion acquisition.com. We've a portfolio at $250 million last year in Edgar revenue. And one of the reasons that we're able to do that is because we know how to extend LTV. And so in this particular instance, we sold in a portfolio company, we widened, we did this thing. Great. So let me tell you you six things that we do to increase LTV. Right. And so I have that frame though. And the warm people are like, well, yeah, I know he owns that stuff. And that's great. The cold people, right? Or like, oh, well, now I know why she listened to this guy. Correct. So I like to make sure that I have both those things together. I think it's also covered in the branding playbook. By the way, that out this point is very, very important because I have seen, especially in direct services, most direct services, professional services, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, coaches, consultants, attorneys, CPAs, they will take, they run their businesses on referrals.

Treat warm light cold. There is a, I'll do a very tactical one. We see a bunch of roll statements on here asking about, hey, they're doing the same thing, a goal, look at the house, and then send like a pricing estimate second. Please do not do that, right?
